Simple Shell Project

This simple shell implementation in C has been created by sunday okafor.

Key Features of this Shell:

1. It provides a command prompt and waits for user input, with each command ending upon a new line.

2. If an executable is not found, it prints an error message and re-displays the prompt.

3. It effectively handles various types of errors.

4. It gracefully manages the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).

5. Supports commands with arguments.

6. Handles the PATH environment variable for executable lookup.

7. Implements a built-in 'exit' command for shell termination.

8. Safely handles Ctrl-C to avoid unintentional shell termination.

9. Effectively manages command separators (';') and logical operators ('&&' and '||').

10. Supports variable replacements using '$'.

11. Recognizes and manages comments indicated by '#'.

12. Offers a history feature to recall previous commands.

13. Supports file input for script execution.
